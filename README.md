# What is Low Level Programming

![Features-of-C-Programming-Language](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126578500/225758194-9742610e-0d3f-4e21-9aeb-859a231edc8c.jpg)

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language.

* TECHNOLOGIES USED : C programming, Graphic programming, Unix programming, Data Structures & algorithms, Reverse engineering & security.

* Objectif : Understand programming languages and Unix system work or “what is going on under the hood”.

## Concepts

*For this project, we expect you to look at this concept*:

### man or help:

* gcc
* printf (3)
* puts
* putchar

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* Why C programming is awesome
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements

## C

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use system
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Shell Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
