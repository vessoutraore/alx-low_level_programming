# What is Low Level Programming

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language.

* TECHNOLOGIES USED : C programming, Graphic programming, Unix programming, Data Structures & algorithms, Reverse engineering & security.

* Objectif : Understand programming languages and Unix system work or “what is going on under the hood”.
